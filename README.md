This project has a front end written in React and a backend written using Node. The front end is hosted on Netlify and the backend server is hosted on Heroku with a MongoDB database. The purpose of it is to be a live Fantasy Football Draft guide that updates as your live draft is going on. 

**MongoDB**

Stores the following information
- Every single NFL player and player information (provided by sleeper [here](https://docs.sleeper.app/#fetch-all-players))
- Collections for individual position rankings. This is split up by (QB, RB, WR, TE, Kicker, Defense/Special Teams and Top 200)

## Available Scripts

To get the project up and running run the following

#### `npm run setup`

This installs all packages for both the React frontend and Node backend

#### `npm run server`

This starts up the Node server.js file to connect to MongoDb as well as starts up the 4 endpoints. You will need a MongoDb user setup to be able to fetch, write, delete and update data in the databse.

#### `npm run site`

This starts up the React frontend of the application. If the Node backend is not running, or if you don't have a Mongodb connection you will need to set that up.

## Backend

### Backend Scripts

#### `npm start`

Starts the backend of the server using Node. No automatic restarting of the server happens with this command.

#### `npm run dev`

Used for running the server locally with Nodemon. Any saves to files will automatically restart the server.

This app runs on: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
