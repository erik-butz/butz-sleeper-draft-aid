After seeing a league-leading 191 a season ago, it’s possible the target volume regresses just a little bit, especially with Allen Robinson now on the roster. Even so, his chemistry with Matthew Stafford and involvement around the goal line make Kupp a no-brainer pick in Round 1 of fantasy drafts.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

It’s possible that efficiency regresses in 2022, but there’s plenty of room for Chase to take a step forward in the target department after seeing just 128 as a rookie. It’s scary to think what Chase could do with 140+ targets in year two…","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

The primary question marks here are if Jalen Hurts can take a step forward as a passer and Philadelphia’s offensive game plan. From Weeks 1-7 last year, they ranked 5th in neutral situation pass rate; from Week 8 on, they completely flipped the script from Week 8 on ranking 2nd in neutral situation rush rate.

"Olamide Zaccheaus","ATL","14","90","77.6","5.3","26.10","10","If you haven't taken a look at the Falcons' depth chart, it's a real treat. We wouldn't recommend doing it while driving or bad things could happen. That depth chart includes Zaccheaus, who could be third in line for targets from ya boy Marcus Mariota. Let's be real, he's a replacement-level talent who is firmly behind Kyle Pitts and Drake London in the pecking order for one of (if not the) worst offense in football. Yucky.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"David Bell","CLE","9","91","77.2","6.0","15.12","10","Bell's range of outcomes in 2022 is pretty wide. A lot will depend on if Deshaun Watson gets to play all 17 games and if Bell can beat out Donovan Peoples-Jones as the WR2. He's been comped to a Jarvis Landry type, and ironically, Landry is no longer in Cleveland.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"Jalen Tolbert","DAL","9","92","73.6","5.3","15.10","10","Because Amari Cooper is now a Brown and Cedrick Wilson is a Dolphin, Dallas is among the leaders in the league in terms of vacated targets available at the WR position. If Tolbert can earn the WR3 role out of camp over James Washington, he could have some fantasy viable weeks in a good passing offense. Look for him on the waiver wire throughout the year.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"George Pickens","PIT","9","93","70.9","6.7","12.06","10","For 2022, we probably shouldn't expect too much given that he'll be competing with Diontae Johnson and Chase Claypool for targets. Of course, there are QB concerns as well with some combination of Kenny Pickett and Mitch Trubisky. He has the type of tools you want in a future WR1 but expecting anything more than being the 4th best option in this offense is probably wishful thinking.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

"Velus Jones Jr.","CHI","14","94","63.5","6.7","24.02","10","Behind Darnell Mooney, the WR depth chart is wide open. Maybe Jones could surprise some people and catch a few passes from Justin Fields? He'll probably start the year as the team's kick and punt returner.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"Anthony Schwartz","CLE","9","95","60.1","4.7","26.04","10","Anthony Schwartz saw just 23 targets as a rookie. He'll have to compete with David Bell and Donovan Peoples-Jones for targets behind Amari Cooper.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"Nelson Agholor","NE","10","96","53.3","5.3","46.07","10","Remember when the Patriots out-bid themselves on Agholor and Kendrick Bourne last free agency period then chose to run the ball at the highest rate in football? Good times. Only four NFL WRs carry a bigger cap hit than Agholor in 2022. Unless the Patriots decide to let Mac Jones throw the ball more this year, they’re paying Agholor a ton of money to block his butt off.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

"Sterling Shepard","NYG","9","97","47.0","9.0","23.09","10","Shepard is coming off a late-season Achilles injury, and a lot of the data shows older players struggle off this surgery. He recently turned 29 years old, suggesting the odds are stacked against him being productive, especially early in the season. While this new look offense under Brian Daboll is something to get excited about, Shepard’s injury makes him a giant question mark…pun intended.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

"Tyquan Thornton","NE","10","98","46.1","6.0","21.08","10","We wouldn't be surprised to see Thornton get stuck behind the other Pats WRs as a rookie. He will probably contribute on special teams to open the year but could find his way onto the field as a field stretcher as the year goes on. Nevertheless, this is a low-volume passing offense and despite his tantalizing speed, he's not on the redraft radar in 2022.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.
